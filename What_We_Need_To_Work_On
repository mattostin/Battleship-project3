What Rohan needs to work on
1. Make HarderBot not shoot twice
^Kind of fixed

Also make it so that the hittiles array list is cleared when a ship is sunk, isSunk(), send bot array list and based on hits for sunk
knows which boat it sunk? or should I just make it so that when it shoots around and hits nothing it assumes it is sunk.

2. Make it so Impossible Bot doesn't shoot twenty times sometimes
and 2 times the other time.

3. Maybe make a campaign version
How would I go about doing this??
3a. Make a new screen, maybe choosing how difficult you want bot to be
3b. Choose how many ships you want?? Maybe make it so you delete from the list.

General/Miscellaneous
1. Server work? Do we need this??
2. Make it so that the tile can be handled up to [50,50]
3. Meow Meow Meow
4. For the Key listeners we can add the KEY_PRESSED, KEY_RELEASED, KEY_TYPED, got from this
5. https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F7%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html
6. Make it so that it keeps being yellow even after the bot makes a bunch of shots, stops highlighting
